Abstract: 
Background: Equine client perceptions and expectations are an under researched, yet critical component of the veterinary–client relationship. This study aimed to better understand how equine clients perceive their veterinarians’ communication skills as well as client's perception related to context of the visit, the horse’s primary use, the veterinarian’s qualifications, the owner’s assumptions about veterinarian expertise, educational cost and salaries. 
 
Methods: An anonymous 28 question survey was distributed to equine owners at the 2018 Kentucky State 4-H Horse Show, 7th Kentucky Fair and Expo Center in Louisville, Kentucky. A combination of descriptive statistics, Spearman’s correlation matrix, and Kruskall-Wallis tests were used to analyze the data.  
 
Results: Two hundred and three owners consented to participate in the survey. Most participants identified eventing or showing (69%) as their horse’s primary purpose and annual wellness care (77%) was the most frequent reason for consulting with a veterinarian. Client perceptions of communication varied significantly based upon the reason for the veterinary visit. Strong correlations were found between the veterinarian's communication skills, and the overall perception of how well the client felt the visit went. 
 
Limitations: This study assessed client perceptions in a limited area within the United States at select equine events. 
 
Conclusions: Client expectations vary significantly based upon the purpose of the visit, suggesting that different types of appointments call for different levels of client involvement.  Expanding future research to include clients from rural areas and those who own companion, working or sports horses would allow meaningful comparisons of expectations across equine roles.
